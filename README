Tk::GraphMan version 0.01
========================

Tk::GraphMan creates a scrolling Windows Task Manager style grid/graph chart (new values are added to the right-side of the graph).
This is a Tk::Canvas widget that has the look and feel of the Windows Task Manager grid/graph chart.

A demonstration script can be found in demo/GraphMan.pl.
The demo script uses the Win32::SystemInfo::CpuUsage and Win32::SystemInfo modules to graph CPU and memory usage.
There are some added bells and whistles in the demo script which can be accessed by right-clicking on the graph.  The graph is also draggable.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
